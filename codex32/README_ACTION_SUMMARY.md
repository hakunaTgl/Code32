## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

### Why 12 Weeks Instead of 20?
1. **Leverage Existing Code:** Container engine, supervisor, WebSocket already built
2. **Parallel Development:** Multiple engineers on different phases
3. **MVP-Driven:** Ship features as they're ready, don't wait for "complete"
4. **Automation First:** CI/CD from Day 1 catches bugs early
5. **Clear Go-Gates:** Kill non-essentials at gates, focus on critical path

### Why $200K Instead of $320K?
1. **Skip redundant work:** Don't rebuild container engine
2. **Parallel execution:** Less overhead
3. **Efficient planning:** No rework
4. **Focused hiring:** Only hire when needed
5. **Cost control:** OpenAI API limits, self-hosted monitoring options

### Why This Works
1. **Clear timeline:** Every day scheduled
2. **Proven process:** Agile + gates + metrics
3. **Team structure:** Right people, right time
4. **Risk mitigation:** 10 risks identified with solutions
5. **Flexibility:** Built-in adjustment mechanisms
