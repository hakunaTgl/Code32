Every week is defined. Every phase has clear success criteria. Every risk is identified and mitigated. Every dollar is budgeted.

**The only question remaining is: Will you commit to executing it?**

If yes → **Start Monday**  
If no → **Document why, revisit in 6 months**  
If deferred → **Set specific review date**
